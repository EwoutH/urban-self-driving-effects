# Sentence outline
## Introduction
The introduction of the automobile changed how people traveled, having both positive and negative effects on people and the environment.

Self-driving cars are the next paradigm shift in personal transportation, offering both oppertunities and challanges.

Proponents highlight several benefits, from cost and travel time reductions to increased road density, comfort, safety and the ability to reclaim space used for parking.

Potential concerns include increased pressure on the road network due to modal shift, induced demand and driving empty between passengers, as well as environmental and health concerns for the population.

The nets effect of these robotaxis remains unclear, including which factors lead to positive or negative outcomes.

Historically, new modalities have increased distance traveled, likely due to fixed travel-time budgets.

Research question: "Which undesired urban problems will the introduction of self-driving cars cause, considering the modal shift and induced demand, and what policies can effectively mitigate undesired impacts?"\

Sub questions:

    A. How can a traffic and mode choice model represent the system that shows the tradeoffs and potentially undesired effects of self-driving cars?
    B. How will self-driving cars be adopted under different future uncertainties?
    C. Which potential undesired system effects are amplified and which are reduced by the introduction of self driving cars?
    D. Which potential policies are most effective in minimizing which undesired system effects while maintaining benefits under different uncertainties?

## Results
### Adoption

With current pricing and total demand, AV adoption would be relatively low, between 1% and 2% depending on peoples value of time.

This would still mean around half a million journeys per day in The Netherlands (since 50 million journeys total).

Price seems to be the most important factor for AV adoption, which could decrease rapidly as tech advances.

A lower value of time seems to be needed for total domination, but not for double-digit % adoption (millions of daily journeys).

As adoption increases, the AV density starts playing an more and more important role.

Induced demand only seems to harm the adoption very little.

For mass adoption costs need to be >4x as cheap, more dense than current cars (but half as dense is enough) and value of time be smaller than in cars.

### Modal shift
